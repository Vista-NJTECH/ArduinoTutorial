* Arduino Mega
  I don't think you will use it and  if so,just google!

## How to Interpret these images?

As you see,these images all has a legend,which is colorful.Each color represents a protocol,for example,brown stands for digital pins and violet stands for the pins that can be used as analog pins.

What is digital and what is analog?We will learn it later and you just need to know digital is just 0 and 1;analog is a nubmer between 0 and 255 or more.
