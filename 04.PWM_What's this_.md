# The definition
Pulse Width Modulation or PWM is a common technique used to change the pulse width in a pulse train.
PWM has many applications, such as controlling servos and speed controllers,limiting the effective power of motors and LEDs.  
  
Pulse width modulation is basically a square wave that changes with time. The basic PWM signal is shown in the figure below.

On-Time : The duration of the time signal is longer.  
Off-Time : The duration of the time signal is short.  
Period-Expressed is the sum of the on-time and off-time of the PWM signal.  
Duty Cycle is expressed as the percentage of time the signal remains on during the PWM signal cycle.

# Example:  

```C++
int ledPin = 10;
int fadeSpeed = 20;

void setup() {
  pinMode(ledPin, OUTPUT);
}

void loop() {
  fadeOn(fadeSpeed, 5);
  fadeOff(fadeSpeed, 5);
}

void fadeIn(unsigned int time, int Increment) {
  for (byte value = 0; value < 255; value += Increment) {
    analogWrite(ledPin, value);
    delay(time);
  }
}
void fadeOut(unsigned int time, int decrement) {
  for (byte value = 255; value > 0; value -= decrement) {
    analogWrite(ledPin, value);
    delay(time);
  }
}
```  

## 1.analogWrite(pin, value)
### Description
The analogWrite() function writes the analog value (PWM wave) to the pin. It can be used to light up LEDs with different brightness or drive motors at various speeds. After calling the analogWrite() function, the pin will generate a stable square wave with the specified duty cycle until the next call to analogWrite() or digitalRead() or digitalWrite() on the same pin.  

### Parameters
------
|Parameter|Instruction|
|:----:|:-----|
|pin|the Arduino pin to write to. Allowed data types: int.|
|value|the duty cycle: between 0 (always off) and 255 (always on). Allowed data types: int.|  

### Returns
------------------
Nothing
